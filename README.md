A full-stack platform revolutionizing organ donation systems through real-time matching and HIPAA-compliant security, built by a passionate new developer pushing technical boundaries.

## :hospital: Problem Addressed
Current organ donation systems suffer from:
- Fragmented donor-recipient databases
- Slow manual matching processes
- Lack of secure communication channels
- No real-time updates for critical cases

## :rocket: Solution Highlights
**Heart2Help implements:**

✅ Role-Based Access Control (JWT + Spring Security)
✅ Real-Time Matching Algorithm (Location/Blood Type/Urgency)
✅ Live Chat & Notifications (WebSocket/Socket.IO)
✅ HIPAA-Compliant Data Handling


## :wrench: Tech Stack
**Backend**  
`Java 17` · `Spring Boot 3` · `Spring Security` · `Hibernate` · `JWT`  

**Frontend**  
`HTML5` · `CSS3` · `JavaScript ES6` · `Thymeleaf`  

**Real-Time**  
`WebSocket` · `Socket.IO` · `STOMP Protocol`  

**Database**  
`MySQL 8` · `Spring Data JPA` · `Liquibase Migrations`  

**DevOps**  
`Maven` · `Postman` · `Git` · `AWS EC2 (Deployment)`

## :star: Key Features
### :shield: Security Architecture
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (Admin/Donor/Receiver)
- Encrypted sensitive health data storage
- Session management with Spring Security

### :mag_right: Intelligent Matching Engine
```java
// Sample matching logic pseudocode
public List<Donor> findMatches(Receiver receiver) {
    return donorRepository.findBy(
        bloodType: receiver.bloodType,
        location: withinRadius(receiver.location, 100km),
        organType: receiver.requiredOrgan
    ).sortBy(urgency: receiver.urgency);
}
